# Fixing FlareBlueML Pipeline Issues

## Overview of Identified Problems

After auditing the FlareBlueML pipeline code and data, several issues were found that explain the unexpected model behavior:

* **Identical Model Outputs:** All classifiers (RF, ELM, LGBM, XGB) were predicting nearly the same class distribution, suggesting a systemic issue (likely class imbalance or a bug in prediction handling) causing the models to default to similar outputs.
* **Negative TSS for XGB:** The XGBoost model showed negative True Skill Statistic (TSS) for some flare classes, indicating it performed worse than random guessing for those classes (often due to class imbalance or mis-scaled labels).
* **Grid Search Tuning Not Reflected:** Although grid search is performed for RF, LGBM, and XGB, the application of the best hyperparameters and reporting of results were not clearly visible, potentially due to how models were saved/refit or lack of output of performance metrics after tuning.
* **Ensemble (ENS) Logic Flawed:** The ensemble model was effectively mirroring the Random Forest’s predictions. The `compute_ens_result` function simply took the RF prediction whenever RF and ELM disagreed, rather than doing a true majority vote. Additionally, the ensemble was only incorporating RF and ELM (since the MLP was removed) and ignoring LGBM and XGB models.
* **Preprocessing Inconsistencies:** There were inconsistencies in feature scaling and normalization between training and testing. For example, if normalization was enabled during training, it wasn’t applied to the test data. ELM models were scaled with `StandardScaler` during training, but the same scaler was not used on test data (instead a new scaler was fit on the test set), which is not a consistent practice.
* **Invalid Dataset Inclusion:** A dataset file (`flaringar_training_sample{OG}.csv`) lacks the `fdate` column required for temporal feature engineering. If accidentally used for training or testing, it would be processed incorrectly (the code would simply skip adding temporal features), leading to inconsistent feature sets. This file should be excluded from the pipeline or handled explicitly.

Below, we address each issue with explanations and provide corrected code snippets and recommendations.

## 1. Ensuring Diverse Model Outputs and Addressing Class Imbalance

**Diagnosis:** The training data is highly imbalanced (e.g., class **C** flares dominate, while class **X** flares are very rare). This imbalance can cause all models to favor the majority class, resulting in similar outputs and low skill in predicting minority classes. The negative TSS values for XGB confirm this – XGB likely over-predicted a minority class or mis-predicted the majority, leading to TPR < FPR for some classes. Additionally, inconsistencies in normalization/scaling could cause models to behave similarly (e.g., if features are not scaled appropriately for one model, it might default to a single class).

**Fixes & Best Practices:**

* **Apply Class Balancing:** Continue using `class_weight='balanced'` for RF and LGBM (this was done in the grid search param grids). For XGB, incorporate class balancing as well. XGBoost doesn’t use `class_weight` directly for multi-class, but we can handle it by using sample weights. Compute weights for each training sample based on class frequency (e.g., inverse of class frequency) and pass them to `XGBClassifier.fit()` via the `fit_params`. This will penalize misclassifying minority classes more strongly. Alternatively, use `scale_pos_weight` for binary classification or consider techniques like oversampling minority classes. In the pipeline, we can add sample weight computation as follows:

  ```python
  # Example: compute sample weights for each class (B, C, M, X)
  class_counts = train_y.value_counts()
  total = len(train_y)
  # Invert frequency: weight = total/(num_classes * count[class])
  weights = train_y.map(lambda cls: total / (4 * class_counts[cls]))
  # Pass these weights to GridSearchCV via fit_params
  gs = GridSearchCV(XGBClassifier(...), param_grid, cv=tscv, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2)
  gs.fit(train_x, train_y, **{'sample_weight': weights})
  ```

  This ensures XGB’s training pays more attention to rare classes, likely improving TSS for those classes (reducing or eliminating negative TSS).

* **Normalize/Scale Consistently:** If feature normalization or scaling is used, it **must** be applied consistently to both training and test data (using parameters derived from the training set). In practice, a `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` fit on training data should transform the test data. In the current code, if `-n/--normalize_data` was set to True, the train features are min-max normalized per column, but the test pipeline did not apply the same normalization. This leads to mismatched feature distributions and can degrade model performance. We suggest either: (a) turning off the `normalize_data` flag (letting tree-based models handle raw values and using the built-in class weights for imbalance), or (b) implementing consistent normalization by saving the scaler from training and applying it in testing. For example, you could modify the code to save the min/max values for each feature during training and scale test features accordingly.

* **ELM Scaling Fix:** The ELM model requires scaling due to how extreme learning machines work. In training, the code applies `StandardScaler` to `train_x` (and would apply to `test_x` if provided). However, in testing, a new scaler is fit to `test_x` (`model_prediction_wrapper` scales `test_x` anew for non-tree models). This is not ideal because it doesn’t use the training distribution. The fix is to reuse the training scaler: save the `StandardScaler` object along with the ELM model. One approach is to create a small wrapper object or a tuple \[model, scaler] to pickle, or simply save the scaler parameters. For simplicity, if real-time reuse is complex, ensure that the scaling approach (standardizing each set independently) is at least documented or consider scaling all data globally. Ideally, we use the training scaler for test data:

  ```python
  # During ELM training, save the scaler
  elm_scaler = StandardScaler().fit(train_x)
  train_x_scaled = elm_scaler.transform(train_x)
  create_model((model, elm_scaler), f"{model_id}_elm", model_dir)  # save tuple

  # During ELM prediction, load the tuple and apply the stored scaler
  model, scaler = load_model(..., f"{model_id}_elm")
  test_x_scaled = scaler.transform(test_x)
  preds = model.predict(test_x_scaled)
  ```

  This way, ELM sees feature distributions in test similar to train.

With these changes, models should no longer all collapse to the same output. The Random Forest, LGBM, and XGB will incorporate class weighting (reducing majority-class bias), and consistent preprocessing will allow each model’s unique behavior to come through. You should start to see variation – for example, XGB might identify a few more minority flares (hopefully correctly, once balanced), and RF/LGBM might differ on borderline cases.

## 2. Fixing Grid Search Hyperparameter Application and Reporting

**Diagnosis:** The code performed grid search for RF, LGBM, and XGB but did not clearly show the impact of tuning on model performance. It printed the `best_params_`, but all models still performed similarly, causing doubt whether tuning was applied. Also, the code may be refitting the model unnecessarily, possibly overriding the tuned model or not saving it properly. Specifically, in `model_train_wrapper`, if a model (like `gs.best_estimator_`) is passed in, the code still calls `.fit()` on it, even though GridSearchCV already refit the best estimator on the full training set.

**Fixes & Best Practices:**

* **Use Best Estimator Directly:** Ensure that the model saved is the tuned model. Modify `model_train_wrapper` to detect if an estimator is already fitted or is coming from GridSearchCV. For example:

  ```python
  def model_train_wrapper(model_name, alg_model, train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id):
      # If alg_model is a GridSearchCV, get the best estimator
      if hasattr(alg_model, "best_estimator_"):
          trained_model = alg_model.best_estimator_
      else:
          # If it's already a fitted model (like best_estimator_), we can use it directly
          trained_model = alg_model  
      # If not yet fitted (no `predict` attr or similar), fit it
      if not hasattr(trained_model, "predict"):
          trained_model.fit(train_x, train_y)
      # Save the trained model to disk
      model_dir = custom_models_dir if model_id != 'default_model' else default_models_dir
      create_model(trained_model, f"{model_id}_{model_name.lower()}", model_dir)
      return trained_model
  ```

  In the training functions, pass the entire `GridSearchCV` object to `model_train_wrapper` (instead of `gs.best_estimator_`). This way, the logic above will extract the already fitted best estimator. This change prevents an unnecessary second `.fit()` and ensures the exact tuned model is saved.

* **Report Performance Metrics after Training:** It’s useful to see how well the tuned model did on training (e.g., cross-validation scores) for transparency. You can capture the cross-validation results from `GridSearchCV.cv_results_` or simply evaluate on the training set (though cross-val is more indicative). For instance, after `gs.fit()`, you might print the best cross-val score:

  ```python
  print(f"RF best CV score: {gs.best_score_:.3f}")
  print(f"Best RF params: {gs.best_params_}")
  ```

  However, since the final evaluation is on a separate test set, focus on test results for actual performance. The key is making sure the model uses tuned parameters – by saving the `best_estimator_`, we achieve that.

* **Logging Hyperparameters:** The pipeline currently prints best parameters to console. Ensure these prints are visible (maybe add a `verbose` flag check or always print). Also consider saving these parameters to the log file or a JSON output for record-keeping. For example:

  ```python
  log(f"Best {model_name} params: {gs.best_params_}", logToTerminal=True)
  ```

  This will append to the log and also print to terminal if verbosity is on.

By clearly applying and logging the best hyperparameters, you make the training process transparent. In the corrected pipeline, the console output during training will show the grid search progress (because `verbose=2` in GridSearchCV) and then the chosen params. The model saved (e.g., `testmodel_rf.sav`) will contain those tuned parameters.

## 3. Correcting the Ensemble Combination Logic

**Diagnosis:** The ensemble (ENS) model currently doesn’t truly combine multiple models’ predictions in a meaningful way. The code only trained RF and ELM under `ENS`, and the `compute_ens_result` function effectively defaults to RF’s prediction whenever RF and ELM disagree. This is not a robust ensemble strategy, and it ignores the contributions of LGBM and XGB. In practice, the ensemble was almost identical to the RF model’s output, which explains why the ENS results were not an improvement.

**Fixes & Strategies:**

* **Train All Models for ENS:** When the user specifies `-a ENS`, the training script should train *all available base models* (RF, ELM, LGBM, XGB). This ensures the ensemble has a full set of predictions to work with. We modify the training logic accordingly:

  ```python
  if alg == 'ENS':
      # Train all base models
      rf_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
      print("Finished RF")
      elm_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
      print("Finished ELM")
      lgbm_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
      print("Finished LGBM")
      xgb_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
      print("Finished XGB")
      print("Ensemble training complete.")
      return  # we can return after training all
  ```

  With this change, running `flareml_train.py -a ENS` will sequentially train and save all four model types. (If needed, you can parallelize or thread this, but sequential is fine given the complexity of each training.)

* **Update Model Existence Checks:** In `flareml_utils.are_model_files_exist`, include LGBM and XGB models in the check for ensemble. The original function returned True for ensemble only if RF and ELM existed, and mistakenly returned True by default for others. Fix it as follows:

  ```python
  def are_model_files_exist(models_dir, modelId, alg='ENS'):
      rf_exists = os.path.isfile(f"{models_dir}/{modelId}_rf.sav")
      elm_exists = os.path.isfile(f"{models_dir}/{modelId}_elm.sav")
      lgbm_exists = os.path.isfile(f"{models_dir}/{modelId}_lgbm.sav")
      xgb_exists = os.path.isfile(f"{models_dir}/{modelId}_xgb.sav")
      if alg == 'ENS':
          # Mark partial ensemble if at least one model exists
          global partial_ens_trained
          partial_ens_trained = any([rf_exists, elm_exists, lgbm_exists, xgb_exists])
          # Full ensemble is ready only if all base models are trained
          return rf_exists and elm_exists and lgbm_exists and xgb_exists
      else:
          # For specific alg, just return that model’s existence
          return {
              'RF': rf_exists,
              'ELM': elm_exists,
              'LGBM': lgbm_exists,
              'XGB': xgb_exists
          }.get(alg, False)
  ```

  This ensures the test script knows if an ensemble is fully trained. If some models are missing (partial), it can handle that (the `partial_ens_trained` flag can be used to warn the user or load what’s available).

* **Majority Voting Ensemble:** Revise the `compute_ens_result` function to perform majority voting across all available model predictions. A robust approach is: for each test sample, collect the predicted class from each model (RF, ELM, LGBM, XGB), then decide the final class by majority vote. For example:

  ```python
  def compute_ens_result(rf_res, elm_res, lgbm_res=None, xgb_res=None):
      # rf_res, elm_res, etc. are numpy arrays of numeric class predictions (1-4)
      final_preds = []
      n = len(rf_res)
      for i in range(n):
          votes = []
          if rf_res is not None: votes.append(int(rf_res[i]))
          if elm_res is not None: votes.append(int(elm_res[i]))
          if lgbm_res is not None: votes.append(int(lgbm_res[i]))
          if xgb_res is not None: votes.append(int(xgb_res[i]))
          # Count votes for each class
          if not votes:
              final_preds.append('N/A')  # No prediction
              continue
          counts = pd.value_counts(votes)  # or use collections.Counter
          # Determine majority class
          top_class = counts.idxmax()  # class with highest count
          # Tie-break strategy:
          if list(counts.values).count(counts.max()) > 1:
              # If tie, choose the class with higher average severity or other rule
              # Here, tie-break by highest class label (X=4 > M=3 > C=2 > B=1)
              top_class = max([cls for cls, cnt in counts.items() if cnt == counts.max()])
          final_preds.append(mapping.get(top_class, 'N/A'))
      return final_preds  # list of final class labels (letters)
  ```

  In the above pseudocode, we use a simple tie-break: if there’s a tie in vote count, we pick the class with the highest numeric code (meaning we favor higher flare classes in a tie, under the assumption that missing a major flare might be worse than a minor one). This is a policy decision – you could also tie-break by always preferring a specific model’s vote (e.g., RF as a tiebreaker like before) or by probabilistic confidence (if available). The chosen method here is just one reasonable approach.

* **Combine All Predictions in Testing:** Update the testing script to utilize all four model predictions for ensemble. In `flareml_test.py`, after obtaining `rf_result, elm_result, lgbm_result, xgb_result`, adjust the ensemble part:

  ```python
  if alg == 'ENS':
      # Only compute ensemble if at least two base models have predictions
      preds_available = [r for r in [rf_result, elm_result, lgbm_result, xgb_result] if r is not None]
      if len(preds_available) >= 2:
          print("Computing ensemble (majority vote)...")
          ens_preds = compute_ens_result(rf_result, elm_result, lgbm_result, xgb_result)
          pm['ENS'] = log_cv_report(true_y, ens_preds)
      else:
          print("Not enough models for ensemble voting; skipping ENS prediction.")
  ```

  With this change, the ensemble prediction `ens_preds` is based on majority voting across all available model outputs. The performance metrics for the ensemble (stored in `pm['ENS']`) will now reflect a true combination, which should ideally outperform individual models if each model contributes some correct predictions for cases others miss.

**Expected Outcome:** After these fixes, the **ENS** results should become more meaningful. For example, if one model predicts an X-class flare correctly while others miss it, the ensemble can still predict it correctly via voting (assuming at least two models vote X, or tie-break favors X). Conversely, if one model makes a spurious prediction, it can be outvoted by the others. The ensemble’s TSS and BACC for each class should be equal or higher than the individual models’ in most cases, demonstrating a successful combination.

## 4. Preprocessing Consistency and Dataset Handling

**Diagnosis:** Inconsistent preprocessing can severely affect model performance and comparability:

* **Normalization Flag:** The `normalize_data` flag min-max scales features in training but wasn’t applied in testing. This mismatch can lead models to make wrong predictions on test data.
* **Temporal Features Requirement:** The function `engineer_temporal_features` skips adding rolling features if `fdate` is missing. The file `flaringar_training_sample{OG}.csv` lacks `fdate`, so using it would mean your model trains without those critical temporal features (making it “see” a different feature set than when temporal features are present). If this dataset was mistakenly included, it could explain some odd outputs.

**Fixes & Best Practices:**

* **Consistent Normalization:** The simplest resolution is to turn **off** `normalize_data` (leave it False) unless you implement it fully. Tree-based models (RF, LGBM, XGB) do not strictly require normalization – they are not distance-based algorithms. ELM (a kind of neural network) does benefit from scaling, but we already handle that with `StandardScaler`. If you do want normalization, do the following:

  * Save the min and max values of each feature from the training set (perhaps in a dict).
  * In `flareml_test.py`, after loading and engineering features, apply the same min-max scaling: `df[col] = (df[col] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)` for each feature, using the saved train `min_val` and `max_val`. This ensures test data is scaled on the same range.
  * Keep in mind not to leak information: compute min/max only on training data (which is fine if test is separate).

  Given the pipeline’s complexity, and since we already scale ELM features, you might choose to leave `normalize_data=False` by default to reduce complexity. If so, update any documentation or help text to reflect that normalization is optional and, if enabled, ensure the user knows to manually apply it to test data or implement the automated approach above.

* **Exclude Invalid Dataset:** Do not use `flaringar_training_sample{OG}.csv` for training or testing. Ideally, remove or segregate it. If needed, add a guard in `load_dataset_csv` or in `train_model`:

  ```python
  df = load_dataset_csv(train_file)
  if 'fdate' not in df.columns:
      print("Dataset does not contain 'fdate'. It cannot be used for temporal feature engineering. Exiting.")
      sys.exit(1)
  ```

  This will prevent accidental usage. In practice, stick to `flaringar_original_data.csv` (which has dates) for training, and other properly formatted datasets for testing. You might keep `flaringar_training_sample{OG}.csv` as a non-temporal baseline, but mixing it with temporal data will cause issues.

* **Ensure Date Sorting:** The temporal feature engineering sorts data by `fdate` before rolling computations. This is correct for time-series modeling. Just ensure that when you separate train/test, you maintain temporal order appropriately (e.g., if the test set is supposed to be the “last” 40 events chronologically, or a random subset). If `flaringar_simple_random_40.csv` is truly random, note that rolling features in test are computed from that subset alone after sorting by date. This might not represent realistic operational use (because the rolling features at test time would ideally come from a continuous time series including prior data). A better practice is to use a contiguous block of time for testing (and use rolling features computed over the sequence). However, since the test set is given and small, the approach is acceptable for evaluation. Just interpret the results with caution: the rolling means in test are not from a live feed but recalculated within the test set.

With consistent preprocessing, the model predictions across train and test will be based on the same data transformations, leading to reliable performance metrics.

## 5. Updated Code Snippets

Below are the key portions of the pipeline with the fixes applied. These include changes to training logic, ensemble combination, and utility functions. Integrating these into your codebase will address the issues discussed:

### **Training Script (`flareml_train.py`)** – Revised to train all models for ENS and apply fixes:

```python
# ... (imports remain mostly the same, but ensure flareml_utils has been updated as per fixes) ...

def train_model(args):
    alg = args.get('algorithm', 'ENS').strip().upper()
    # Validate algorithm
    if alg not in algorithms:
        print(f"Invalid algorithm: {alg}. Must be one of: {algorithms}")
        sys.exit(1)
    train_file = args.get('train_data_file', TRAIN_INPUT).strip()
    if not train_file or not os.path.isfile(train_file):
        print(f"Training data file invalid or not found: {train_file}")
        sys.exit(1)
    modelid = args.get('modelid', 'default_model').strip()
    if not modelid:
        print("Model id cannot be empty.")
        sys.exit(1)
    if modelid.lower() == 'default_model':
        ans = input("Using default_model will overwrite defaults. Continue? [y/N] ")
        if not boolean(ans):
            print("Exiting...")
            sys.exit(1)
    normalize = boolean(args.get('normalize_data', False))
    verbose = boolean(args.get('verbose', False))
    set_log_to_terminal(verbose)
    log('Arguments:', args)
    print(f"Loading training data: {train_file}")
    df = load_dataset_csv(train_file)
    # Ensure dataset has 'fdate' for temporal features
    if 'fdate' not in df.columns:
        print("Error: Training dataset has no 'fdate' column. Cannot engineer temporal features.")
        sys.exit(1)
    df = engineer_temporal_features(df, window_size=6)
    # Drop unused columns
    for col in ['goes', 'fdate', 'goesstime', 'flarec', 'noaaar']:
        df = removeDataColumn(col, df)
    if flares_col_name not in df.columns:
        print(f"Missing target column '{flares_col_name}' in dataset.")
        sys.exit(1)
    # Convert target classes to numeric codes
    df['flarecn'] = [convert_class_to_num(x) for x in df[flares_col_name]]
    df = removeDataColumn(flares_col_name, df)
    # Optional normalization (min-max scaling) on features
    if normalize:
        for c in df.columns:
            if c != 'flarecn':
                df[c] = normalize_scale_data(df[c].values)
    train_y = df['flarecn']
    train_x = removeDataColumn('flarecn', df)
    # **No explicit test set in training phase** (we'll use separate test script)
    test_x = test_y = None

    print("Training in progress...")
    if alg == 'ENS':
        # Train all base models for ensemble
        rf_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
        print("Finished RF training.")
        elm_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
        print("Finished ELM training.")
        lgbm_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
        print("Finished LGBM training.")
        xgb_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
        print("Finished XGB training.")
    elif alg == 'RF':
        rf_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
    elif alg == 'ELM':
        elm_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
    elif alg == 'LGBM':
        lgbm_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
    elif alg == 'XGB':
        xgb_train_model(train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y, model_id=modelid)
    else:
        # This case shouldn’t happen due to earlier check
        print(f"Unsupported algorithm: {alg}")
        sys.exit(1)

    print(f"Training complete for algorithm {alg}. You may now run flareml_test.py.")
```

**Key changes in `train_model`:** When `alg == 'ENS'`, we call each model’s train function. We also added a check for the `fdate` column and improved logging. The normalization flag is still available but should be used with caution (and corresponding test handling, not shown above for brevity).

### **Utility Functions (`flareml_utils.py`)** – Revised ensemble check, model saving, and ensemble voting:

```python
# Directory settings remain the same (custom_models_dir, default_models_dir, etc.)

# Update supported algorithms list if needed (already ['ENS', 'RF', 'ELM', 'LGBM', 'XGB'])

def are_model_files_exist(models_dir, modelId, alg='ENS'):
    rf_exists = os.path.isfile(f"{models_dir}/{modelId}_rf.sav")

**Summary of changes in utils:** We implemented proper file existence checks for all models, added sample weighting for XGB grid search, fixed `model_train_wrapper` to avoid refitting tuned models, and rewrote `compute_ens_result` to do majority voting with tie-breaking. We also tweaked `model_prediction_wrapper` to handle the possibility of an ELM model saved with its scaler.

**Summary of changes in test script:** We use a helper `safe_model_predict` to load each model’s predictions safely. We then perform ensemble voting if possible. We’ve also included printing of confusion matrices and metrics for each model (so you can see if their outputs truly differ). If normalization was used in training, we attempt to normalize test features similarly (this part may need actual train min/max values if precision is required). The performance metrics printing remains the same format.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

After applying these fixes, retrain your models and run the test pipeline again. You should observe:

* **Varied Predictions:** Each model (RF, ELM, LGBM, XGB) should now output a distinct prediction pattern, leveraging their algorithmic differences. For example, you might find XGB identifies some minority class flares that RF misses, etc.
* **Improved TSS Scores:** Especially for the XGB model, the introduction of class-balanced sample weights should boost its TSS for minority classes (eliminating negative TSS values). All models should generally see an improvement in balanced accuracy (BACC) and TSS for the harder classes (M and X), thanks to class weighting.
* **Ensemble Performance:** The ensemble (ENS) model will combine all four predictions. If one model’s output is noisy, the others can outvote it. The ensemble’s majority voting should yield equal or better BACC/TSS for each class compared to individual models. Check the printed metrics: the ENS Class 4 (X) TSS, for instance, should improve if any model correctly predicted X flares.
* **Proper Reporting:** The training console will show the best hyperparameters for each model and (optionally) their CV scores. The testing output will clearly list performance metrics per class for each model and the ensemble, making it easy to compare.
* **Consistent Processing:** With the preprocessing fixes, you won’t have a scenario where, say, RF was trained on normalized data but tested on raw data (which would impair performance). Each model sees a consistent data format across training and testing.
* **Data Usage:** By excluding the improperly formatted dataset and ensuring temporal features are only used when `fdate` is present, you avoid subtle bugs that could arise from inconsistent feature sets.

**Recommended Practices Going Forward:**

* **Maintain Data Consistency:** Always ensure the train and test data undergo the same feature engineering and scaling. If you update the pipeline (e.g., add new features), apply those changes uniformly.
* **Monitor Class Imbalance:** Continue using strategies like class\_weight or sample\_weight for imbalanced data, and consider techniques like SMOTE or stratified splits if expanding the pipeline, especially if the distribution shifts over time.
* **Evaluate Ensemble Value:** Keep an eye on whether the ensemble is genuinely adding performance. If one model consistently underperforms, it might hurt ensemble results (e.g., always being outvoted or adding noise). In such a case, you might drop that model or weight votes unevenly (e.g., give more weight to models with higher past accuracy). Currently, we used equal voting with a simple tie-break rule.
* **Logging and Versioning:** Save not just the models but also the hyperparameters and preprocessing steps used for each training run (perhaps as a JSON or in the log). This makes it easier to reproduce results or debug if something still seems off. For example, log the class distribution and any computed weights, so you know how the training was balanced.
* **Testing with Temporal Logic:** Since this is time-series data, eventually consider using a *time-forward* split for evaluation (training on older events, testing on newer events) rather than random selection. This will give a more realistic picture of model performance in deployment (where we predict future flares from past data). The rolling features would then be computed continuously.

With these corrections, the FlareBlueML pipeline should function as intended: each model providing its unique predictions, and the ensemble aggregating them for a more robust final prediction. You will be able to trust the reported TSS and BACC values as accurate reflections of model skill for each flare class. Good luck, and clear skies for your model’s performance!
